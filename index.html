		Python:I am learning python since the second semester of my college ,i enjoy coding in the python ,as well as learning it .for me its love to code in python because you dont have to think about those curly braces and semicolon after code,python just gives you a freedom to what whatever you want,everyone say python is easy ,but i think it is'nt easy ,its just interesting ,and the person who start code in Python surely love to code in python.

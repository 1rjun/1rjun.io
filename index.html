	Python:I am learning python since the second semester of my college ,i enjoy 
	coding in the python ,as well as learning it .for me its love to code in python 
	because you dont have to think about those curly braces and semicolon after code
	,python just gives you a freedom to what whatever you want,everyone say python 
	is easy ,but i think it is'nt easy ,its just interesting ,and the person who start
	 code in Python surely love to code in python.

	are the building blocks of the any webpage design,i am still learning html,css and js

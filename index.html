	Python:I am learning python since the second semester of my college ,i enjoy 
	coding in the python ,as well as learning it .for me its love to code in python 
	because you dont have to think about those curly braces and semicolon after code
	,python just gives you a freedom to do whatever you want,everyone say python 
	is easy ,but i think it is'nt easy ,its just interesting ,and the person who start
	 code in Python surely love to code in python.
	</li><br>
	<li>Html,Css and Javascript: I know how to code in basic html ,css and javascript ,these
	are the building blocks of the any webpage design,i am still learning html,css and js 
	because there is no end of learning .</li><br>
	<li>Sqlite3: I use Sqlite3 when i use to code in python flask microframework,and i use it for the 
		database creation .for connectivity of the database i use the flask_sqlalchemy which enables me
		to create the table with the help of python code by using the objects and the classes.

		Flask:Flask is the microframework of the python programming ,i use it to make simple webpages and 
		some crud application,i loved using this framework because of its easy nature and its fun 
		to code in flask.I am learning it from my past 6 months.
